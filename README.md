# gsynth
Homemade software offering synthesized explanations of basic git commands while working on terminal

I wanted some way to have a quick reminder of how to use git commands while working on the terminal.
In the end it should be able to be called in the terminal by typing 'gsynth' and provide quick insights on
how to configure git, how to track projects, etc.

This project is very unfinished for the moment so don't expect it to work! I'm new to programming and lack lots of concepts
so if you have a look in the source code you'll probably find that's it's a genuine mess despite my efforts to clean it. 
Constructive criticism would be more than welcome though (but keep in mind that I'm NEW to programming so please adapt your 
comments to my level, I'd more than grateful if you did) !

Finally, I'd be more than grateful if you cloned this project to help me. I'm usually not grumpy (except in the morning 
sometimes...) so feel free to contact me if you want !

Enjoy your day!
