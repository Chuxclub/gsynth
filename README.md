# gsynth
Synthesized explanations of basic git commands software

I wanted some way to have a quick reminder of how to use git commands while working on the terminal. In the end I wanted it to be able to be called in the terminal by typing 'gsynth' and to provide quick insights on how to configure git, how to track projects, etc.

This project works but I'm new to programming and hence lack lots of concepts so if you have a look in the source code you'll probably find that's it's a genuine mess despite my efforts to clean it.

If you want to use it you have to follow these steps: 
  1. Clone this repository
  2. Open terminal using Ctrl + Alt + t shortcut
  3. Enter in the terminal: gedit ~/.bash_aliases
  4. Enter in ~/.bash_aliases file: alias gsynth='cd ~/gsynth && ./gsynth && cd -' in

Note: You can change the directory in which you save gsynth, just edit cd ~/gsynth in step 4 with the corresponding path

Constructive criticism would be more than welcome though (but keep in mind that I'm NEW to programming so please adapt your 
comments to my level, I'd more than grateful if you did) !

Enjoy your day!
